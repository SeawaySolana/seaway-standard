# Seaway standard

Welcome to the seaway standard repository, Seaway is solana powered membership standard that use NFT.

Through Seaway, dapps developers can easily create membership based decentralized application. The standard aim to provide content creators a direct and transparent connection to their users and full control over their revenue.


## How it works

### Core concept

Creators memberships consist of NFTs collections and each subscription is backed by an NFT
There are 3 entities involved:
- **Establishment**: the establishment correspond to the dapps that will provide content, or mechanism for creator to provide content. You can use the default seaway establishment or use your own. Establishment can control the fees applied to the royalties or subscription of a user to creators.
- **Creators**: Creators must register to a specific establishment
- **Memberships**: Creator can create different king of membership with a custom price, a custom supply. Once a user subscribe to a creator using a specific membership, he is issued with an NFT representing this subscription.
